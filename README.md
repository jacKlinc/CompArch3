Repo for all work done Computer Architecture 3 module. 

Lab1_Endian shows the difference in approaches to storing data in a computer, the program checks if the computer is either little or big Endian.

Lab1_Flops showcases a computer’s ability to compute data types. The data types used are short and long integers, floating point number and double floats. The time taken to compute these is measured using a timer and the resulting times are compared at the end. 

Formal Element includes a cache simulator written in C++. The cache simulator has three different architectures used: 
  •	Direct Mapped, the fastest but least reliable
  •	2-Way Set Associative, which is essentially two Direct Mapped caches stacked on top 
  •	Fully Associative, which is the most reliable but the costliest. 

The full report is shown in the .docx.
